**Presented by**: Marie-Hélène Burle

**Duration**: 80 minutes

**Description**: R is a free and open-source programming language for statistical computing, modelling, and
graphics, with an unbeatable collection of statistical packages. It is extremely popular in some academic
fields such as statistics, biology, bioinformatics, data mining, data analysis, and linguistics.

This introductory course does not assume any prior knowledge: it will take you through the first steps of
importing, cleaning, and visualizing your data. Along the way, we will get familiar with R data types,
functions writing, and control flow.

**Technical requirements**: The hands-on workshop environment will only require a modern Web browser. A second
screen is recommended to be able to follow instructions on one screen and write code on a separate screen.
