**Presented by**: Beth Knazook, Robyn Nicholson, Yvette Rancourt, Victoria Smith, Erin Clay, and Kelly Stathis

**Duration / Durée**: 120 minutes

**Description**: Research data management, or RDM, is increasingly recognized as an important part of the research enterprise in all disciplines, including the humanities and social sciences. With the introduction of the Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy, and the broad recognition of principles such as FAIR, CARE, and OCAP, it’s crucial for researchers to understand and adopt good RDM practices. You’ll be glad you did! This workshop will give you an overview of the essentials of RDM, with tips, resources, and tools that you can begin to incorporate into your work right away. Topics will include:
- What counts as research data
- What a data management plan is, and how it can help you
- What data curation is, and why it’s important
- What to consider when sharing your data with other researchers
- What to consider when preserving your data for the long term
- What data might be considered sensitive, and how to ensure that these data are properly managed
