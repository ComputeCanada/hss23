**Presented by**: Kaylin Land

**Duration**: 80 minutes

**Description**: Voyant Tools is a web-based tool for digital textual analysis. A suite of analysis and
visualization tools allows researchers to “see through” texts and gain insight from word frequency, collocated
terms, and other metrics. Voyant Tools is unique because it requires no set-up ahead of time and is
user-friendly for those without any coding skills.
 
 In this workshop, we introduce participants to Voyant, showing how to create your own corpus in Voyant to
 analyze digital texts. We will walk you through the basics of finding, formatting, and uploading a text to
 use in Voyant including cleaning your text. We will demonstrate many of Voyant’s capabilities including
 visualization tools to create word clouds, word frequency trend graphs, and more playful visualizations that
 allow you to play with your text. We will also discuss the basics of designing a textual analysis project and
 give you ideas for using Voyant in your own research.
