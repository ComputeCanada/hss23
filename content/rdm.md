**February 15, 2023, 1:00pm-2:20pm EST**

**Presented by**: Shahira Khair & Matt Huculak

**Duration**: 80 minutes

**Description**: In this hands-on and discussion-centered workshop we will discuss and identify unique
considerations for managing “humanities and social sciences research data”. In this workshop we will introduce
you to the basic lifecycle of data--including your own personal data. We will learn about different formats
(proprietary vs. open), software, and metadata for your data. Finally, through discussion, we will think
through the question: what state of your data will be most useful for you to share with the community?

During this session, we will:
- Create a data inventory of your existing data
- Map out the personal data lifecycle

At the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Differentiate data formats
- Give examples of good shareable humanities data
- Express some of your data needs for data management plans
- Sketch your personal data inventory
- Recognize good data for long-term access and preservation

Finally, you will be prepared to think through submitting your data to national repositories (see Session-2-3).
