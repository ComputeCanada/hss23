**Presented by**: Lucas Nogueira

**Duration**: 110 minutes

**Description**: Machine Learning is without a doubt one of the biggest buzzwords in tech in recent times. No
wonder - it is what powers many of the innovations we have all grown to love in this last decade: from the
autocomplete function and the virtual assistant on your phone, to self-parking cars and the recommender system
on your favorite streaming service.

What many people don’t know is that Machine Learning is not new. In fact, it can be seen as nothing more than
a change of perspective on a much older field that is well-known to the HSS community: good old Statistics.

In this workshop, we will look beyond the Computer-Science-centered jargon of Machine Learning and show, with
examples, how your existing knowledge of Statistics translates into Machine Learning and provides all you need
to learn more about this exciting field.

**Technical requirements**: The hands-on workshop environment will only require a modern Web browser. A second
screen is recommended to be able to follow instructions on one screen and write code on a separate screen.

#### Biography

**Lucas Nogueira** is a statistics drop-out turned computer engineer and is currently a scientific analyst at
Calcul Québec. His interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence and decision making under
uncertainty. He believes science has long had a language problem, where things are made to look and feel way
more complex than they really are. He holds a Masters of Management Innovation & Entrepreneurship from Queen's
University and a graduate diploma in statistics from Stanford University (he did drop back into stats
eventually).
