**Duration**: 80 minutes

**Description**: The Sensitive Data Repository Project is a FRDR-led collaborative initiative designed to
equip Canadian data repositories with the technology and policy framework elements needed to ingest and manage
controlled access to sensitive research data, ensuring long-term storage of valuable data assets and enabling
potential data re-use. The project involves piloting new technology, collaboratively co-developing workflows
and processes with researchers and their institutions, and developing and deploying best practice-driven
training and education opportunities for researchers and research support staff. Institutions are invited to
join the cohort piloting this exciting initiative.
