**Presented by**: Meghan Landry

**Duration**: 80 minutes

**Description**: This Library Carpentry adapted lesson introduces people working in Humanities, Social
Sciences, and library- and information-related roles to working with data in OpenRefine. OpenRefine can be
used to standardize and clean data across your file, and is most useful when working with a comma separated
values file (csv) or a tab delimited file (tsv). It can help you get an overview of a data set; resolve
inconsistencies in a data set; help you split data up into more granular parts; and more. At the conclusion of
the lesson you will understand what the OpenRefine software does and how to use the OpenRefine software to
work with data files. No previous experience with OpenRefine is required.
