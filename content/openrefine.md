**Presented by**: Meghan Landry

**Duration**: 80 minutes

**Description**: This Data Carpentry adapted lesson introduces people working in Humanities, Social
Sciences, and library- and information-related roles to working with data in OpenRefine. OpenRefine can be
used to standardize and clean data across your file, and is most useful when working with a comma separated
values file (csv) or a tab delimited file (tsv). It can help you get an overview of a data set; resolve
inconsistencies in a data set; help you split data up into more granular parts; and more. At the conclusion of
the lesson you will understand what the OpenRefine software does and how to use the OpenRefine software to
work with data files. No previous experience with OpenRefine is required.

**Technical requirements**: Participants will need to install Java and
OpenRefine on their computer.
[**Setup instructions**](#setup-instructions) can be found in a section below
and will be provided by email prior to the series.

## Setup instructions

The below instructions come from
[Data Carpentry: OpenRefine for Social Science Data](https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/setup.html).

### Installation

1. Download OpenRefine
   [here](https://openrefine.org/download.html)
2. If Java is not embedded in the OpenRefine installer, you will need to
   [install this dependency](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/installing#system-requirements).
3. Install OpenRefine by following instructions
   [here](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/installing#installing-or-upgrading).

You may ask for help on Slack if you are having any problem with these
installation steps.

### Data

For this workshop, we will use the following CSV file:
[SAFI_openrefine.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11502815).
* **Note carefully where** you save this file on your computer, because
  we will use it in OpenRefine at the beginning of the workshop.
* **About the data**: it is a part of the Data Carpentry workshop.
  It is a teaching version, which is in fact a subset of the
  *Studying African Farmer-Led Irrigation* (SAFI) database
  that has been intentionally *messed up* for the tutorial.
