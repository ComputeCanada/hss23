**Presented by**: Kaylin Land

**Duration**: 110 minutes

**Description**: In this workshop we provide participants a chance to perform hands-on textual analysis with
Voyant Tools, a web-based tool for digital textual analysis. The workshop will also feature Spyral Notebooks,
a new companion notebook environment that works in tandem with Voyant Tools. Participants will bring their own
corpus of digital texts for analysis and we will walk through using Voyant with your text. We will demonstrate
how to use Spyral Notebooks to save, share, and enhance your Voyant analysis.
