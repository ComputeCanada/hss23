**Presented by**: Alex Razoumov

**Duration**: 80 minutes

**Description**: In this very short (1h20m) introduction to Python, we will cover the basics of running Python
inside Jupyter notebooks, basic use of variables, lists, dictionaries, talk about defining functions and using
external libraries. We will provide Python in the cloud, so there is no need to install it on your own
computer for this session.

#### Biography

**Alex Razoumov** earned his PhD in computational astrophysics from the University of British Columbia and
held postdoctoral positions in Urbana–Champaign, San Diego, Oak Ridge, and Halifax. He has worked on numerical
models ranging from galaxy formation to core-collapse supernovae and stellar hydrodynamics, and has developed
a number of computational fluid dynamics and radiative transfer codes and techniques. He spent five years as
HPC Analyst in SHARCNET helping researchers from diverse backgrounds to use large clusters, and in 2014 moved
back to Vancouver to focus on scientific visualization and training researchers to use advanced computing
tools. He is now with Simon Fraser University.
