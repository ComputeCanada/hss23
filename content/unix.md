**Presented by**: Grace Fishbein

**Duration**: 80 minutes

**Description**: Most introductions to a command line interface are targeted at using the interface as a
gateway to some other tool that it doesn’t make sense to access in any other way. This workshop will be
different because it will introduce you to using the command line interface to actually do work directly on
the command line. Why would anyone want to do this you ask? In many cases the command line is faster and
offers abilities that other tools do not, especially when working with raw text files. This will be a hands-on
workshop that assumes no previous knowledge. While specific examples will be considered throughout the point
of the workshop will be to highlight possible future applications that participants might be interested in.

**Technical requirements**: The hands-on workshop environment will only require a modern Web browser. A second
screen is recommended to be able to follow instructions on one screen and write commands on a separate
screen. Setup instructions can be found [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html).
